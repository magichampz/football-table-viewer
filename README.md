# football-table-viewer

Made some functions to analyse football match and table statistics overtime. The idea was to allow us to reproduce the league table from previous seasons at different points during the season, and use this table to train a match score predictor model and test its accuracy using the actual results. 

There were no other websites or services online that seemed to allow us to view the table at a random point in time in a past season, hence these functions were created.

The jupyter notebook uploaded uses data from the 2021-2022 premier league season, obtained https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php. The functions can easil  be modified to work for other seasons and leagues.
